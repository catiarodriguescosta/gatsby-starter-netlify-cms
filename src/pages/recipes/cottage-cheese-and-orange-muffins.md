Ingredients: |-
  `<p>300 gr fat free natural cottage cheese</p>`

  `<p>1 orange (zest and juice)</p>`

  `<p>2 tbsp cornflour</p>`

  `<p>2 triangles “The Laughting Cow”</p>`

  `<p>8 — 15 tbsp Stevia</p>`
Procedure: >-
  1. Heat the oven to 180ºC.

  2. Beat all the ingredients together except the orange zest (I used a liquidifier). I recommend to use the 8tbsp of stevia first and then adjust it to your own preference.

  3. Add the orange zest and stir.

  4. Fill the muffins cases and bake them for 40minutes.
