    This blog is plenty of good recipes and tips that could help you and inspire
    you.

    They all have in mind the Slimming World principles and all the recipes have the syns and Health Extra Options used. I’m trying to discover new flavours, trying new veggies, new dishes and once in a while I love to do a vegetarian dish too. I’m not vegetarian but I think all of us should make an effort to remove fish and meat once in a while.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
